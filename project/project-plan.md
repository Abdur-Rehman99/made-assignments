# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How effective are technological and political measures in reducing human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, and what is their impact on global climate change?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The two datasets aim to tackle environmental challenges from different angles. The first dataset addresses the broad issue of climate change by analyzing human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and exploring solutions to reduce these emissions globally. The second dataset focuses on enhancing local environmental management by improving the tracking and analysis of tree planting activities, which helps in carbon sequestration and urban greening. Together, they contribute to understanding and mitigating climate change impacts at both global and local scales.
