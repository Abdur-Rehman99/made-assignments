# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Awesome MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How effective are technological and political measures in reducing human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, and what is their impact on global climate change?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The two datasets aim to tackle environmental challenges from different angles. The first dataset addresses the broad issue of climate change by analyzing human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and exploring solutions to reduce these emissions globally. The second dataset focuses on enhancing local environmental management by improving the tracking and analysis of tree planting activities, which helps in carbon sequestration and urban greening. Together, they contribute to understanding and mitigating climate change impacts at both global and local scales.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: City of Neuss: tree plantings 2023
* Metadata URL: [https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/stadt-neuss-baumplantungen-2023.rdf](https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/stadt-neuss-baumplantungen-2023.rdf)
* Data URL: [https://opendata.rhein-kreis-neuss.de/api/v2/catalog/datasets/stadt-neuss-herbstpflanzung-2023/exports/csv](https://opendata.rhein-kreis-neuss.de/api/v2/catalog/datasets/stadt-neuss-herbstpflanzung-2023/exports/csv)
* Data Type: CSV

Data on tree plantings in 2023. Numerous different tree species were selected for autumn tree planting - including oaks, walnut and cherry trees,
various types of linden trees and sweetgum trees, which are particularly resistant to heat and drought. Because of these properties, the sweetgum tree is just as considered a “climate tree” as are hackberry trees, whitebeams or locust trees, all of which are also among the selected species

### Datasource1: Clean Tree Planting Data 2023
* Metadata URL: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadmottershead/clean-planting-data-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadmottershead/clean-planting-data-2023)

* Data Type: CSV

One of the major challenges of the program in past years has been accurately tracking what types of plants get planted where over the course of each planting season. In this project, I took data from many different sources and compiled them into a usable database format for analysis. Two different ways of cleaning data are reflected in the associated Jupyter Notebook.
